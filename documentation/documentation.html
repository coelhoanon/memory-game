that's where all the products in the store are. I created an array of objects where
each object represents a product in the store, so if you want to add
a new item to the store, you just need to add a new object with the features

face up, and after a while they turn around and the game begins, when the
player clicks on a card it turns, after clicking on two cards the algorithm checks if they are the same,
if so, they are turned over until the end of the game, otherwise, the two cards turn over again. If the player hits all the cards before time runs out, he wins, otherwise he loses.

the game. When the player clicks on the audio icons, the states of the audios are saved in place

units of the same item, the same number will be recorded twice. Repeating this count

to define whether the cards will be standard or not.

drawn, making the cards now all shuffled every time
html elements (letters) are created.

	<br>

	<h4>
		Right after the cards are shuffled and created, they are given an id in the value attribute of the cards to identify the pairs of cards. It works like this ... two FOR loops are made

		The cards are created with the face open, so that the player can memorize the cards before starting to play (that's why it's called the memory game, not the guessing game), when all the cards have already been created,
they are turned over for a certain time (2200) and only then do they turn around.

turn more than two cards at a time. When there are no cards dealt, the spin function is activated, and when
there is already a card turned over, verification is made that they are the same. If there is a match between the cards the player wins gold and XP.
